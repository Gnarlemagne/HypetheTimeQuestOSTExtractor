# Tonic Trouble Audio Converter - Library

## CREDITS & DISCLAIMERS

This library is an adaptation of the incredible work done by the CTPAX-X team in creating the Tonic Trouble Audio Converter (tonictac) tool. If I wasn't so weak willed, I could have built this whole project on the backs of the tonictac source code, but the highly efficient C that they've built is beautiful in its own right but hurts my puny brain.

Their work in parsing the data structures of the ancient and horrifying .bnm audio format is truly amazing, and I could never have done it on my own.
